Diff b/w runtime and framework

-> Runtime is actually an environment that provides resources for a particular program/process to run. for ex- here program and process is the js, so browser and nodejs provides the lot of resources to javascript to run.

-> framework - ex - if we want to cook food, will need vegetables (someone already knew like farmers so they have grown it and solved our problem, we need to only cook) similarly framework and libraries help us to solve the common problem.

features and resources
In order to run your comp m/c need cpu, RAM, h/w  these are `resources` but os gives you lots of `features` ex, ui to actually access the h/ws.

Why `libuv`?
  In simple terms there can be different architecture and diff implms for the same feature in diff os (ex- In linux reading a file is blocking whereas in windows it's non blocking)
