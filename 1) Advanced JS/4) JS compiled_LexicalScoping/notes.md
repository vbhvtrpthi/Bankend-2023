Hoisting in JavaScript is a behavior where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase. This means that regardless of where variables and functions are declared in the code, they are conceptually moved to the top of their scope.

However, it's important to understand that only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations or assignments. Let's break this down for variables and functions:

1. **Variable Hoisting:** In JavaScript, when you declare a variable with `var`, `let`, or `const`, the declaration (but not the initialization) is hoisted to the top of its scope. For example:

    ```javascript
    console.log(myVar); // Output: undefined
    var myVar = 10;
    console.log(myVar); // Output: 10
    ```

    The variable `myVar` is hoisted, so the first `console.log` doesn’t throw an error, but it logs `undefined` because the initialization is not hoisted.

2. **Function Hoisting:** Function declarations are also hoisted in JavaScript. This means you can call a function before it is declared:

    ```javascript
    sayHello(); // Output: "Hello!"

    function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
    }
    ```

    The function `sayHello()` is hoisted to the top, so it can be called before the actual declaration in the code.

However, it's important to note that function expressions (where a function is assigned to a variable) are not hoisted in the same way as function declarations:

```javascript
sayHi(); // This will throw an error

var sayHi = function() {
  console.log("Hi!");
};
```

Here, `sayHi` is hoisted as a variable, but the assignment isn’t hoisted, so calling it before the assignment throws an error.

Understanding hoisting helps in predicting how JavaScript behaves during the code execution, especially in cases where variables or functions might seem to be used before they're declared.

# In example 1st you have written let and const, so they are hoisted too ?

`let` and `const` also exhibit hoisting, but with a slight difference compared to `var`.

When using `let` and `const`, they are hoisted to the top of their block scope, but unlike `var`, they are not initialized. This means that while the variable declaration is hoisted, you cannot access the variable before the actual line where it’s declared:

```javascript
console.log(myVar); // This will throw a ReferenceError
let myVar = 10;
console.log(myVar); // Output: 10
```

In this case, `myVar` is hoisted to the top of the block but is not initialized. Accessing it before the declaration line throws a `ReferenceError` because it's in a "temporal dead zone" until the line where it's actually declared.

So, with `let` and `const`, while the declaration is hoisted, the variables aren’t initialized until the interpreter reaches their actual declaration in the code, unlike `var` which gets initialized with `undefined` during hoisting.

# Difference between let var and const

Sure, `let`, `var`, and `const` are all used to declare variables in JavaScript, but they have some key differences:

1. **`var`:** `var` was the original way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with `var` are function-scoped or globally-scoped. They are hoisted to the top of their function scope (if declared inside a function) or to the global scope (if declared outside any function). `var` allows redeclaration and reassignment.

    ```javascript
    var x = 10;
    var x = 20; // Allowed: Redeclaration
    x = 30; // Allowed: Reassignment
    ```

2. **`let`:** Introduced in ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), `let` allows you to declare variables that are block-scoped (scoped to the nearest curly braces `{}`). Variables declared with `let` can be reassigned but cannot be redeclared within the same scope.

    ```javascript
    let y = 10;
    // let y = 20; // Not allowed: Cannot redeclare
    y = 30; // Allowed: Reassignment
    ```

3. **`const`:** Also introduced in ES6, `const` declares variables that are block-scoped like `let`, but once a value is assigned, it cannot be reassigned. It must be initialized at the time of declaration, and it cannot be redeclared or reassigned within the same scope.

    ```javascript
    const z = 10;
    // const z = 20; // Not allowed: Cannot redeclare
    // z = 30; // Not allowed: Cannot reassign
    ```

The main differences between them lie in their scoping rules, redeclaration, and reassignment capabilities. `var` is function-scoped, allows redeclaration, and has some quirks related to hoisting. `let` and `const` are block-scoped, `let` allows reassignment but not redeclaration, while `const` doesn't allow reassignment or redeclaration after initialization.
