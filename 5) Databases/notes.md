# SUM
Certainly! The `SUM()` function in SQL is used to calculate the sum of values in a particular column. Here's an example:

Consider a table named `sales`:

| id | amount |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 150    |
| 3  | 200    |
| 4  | 75     |
| 5  | 300    |

If you want to calculate the total sales amount from the `amount` column, you can use the `SUM()` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount) AS total_sales FROM sales;
```

The result of this query will return:

| total_sales |
|-------------|
| 825         |

The `SUM()` function aggregates all the values in the `amount` column and returns the total sum as `total_sales`. You can also use `SUM()` with conditions or in combination with other functions for more complex calculations.

Certainly! The `AVG()` and `COUNT()` functions in SQL are used to calculate average and count of values, respectively.

### AVG() Function:

Consider the same `sales` table:

| id | amount |
|----|--------|
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 150    |
| 3  | 200    |
| 4  | 75     |
| 5  | 300    |

#### Calculating Average Sales Amount:

```sql
SELECT AVG(amount) AS average_sales FROM sales;
```

Result:
| average_sales |
|---------------|
| 165           |

The `AVG()` function calculates the average value of the `amount` column and returns the result as `average_sales`.

### COUNT() Function:

#### Counting Total Number of Sales Records:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales_records FROM sales;
```

Result:
| total_sales_records |
|---------------------|
| 5                   |

The `COUNT()` function with `*` counts all records in the table and returns the total number of sales records as `total_sales_records`.

#### Counting Non-Null Values in a Column:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(amount) AS total_non_null_sales FROM sales;
```

Result:
| total_non_null_sales |
|----------------------|
| 5                    |

This query counts the non-null values in the `amount` column and returns the total number of non-null sales records as `total_non_null_sales`.

These functions, `AVG()` and `COUNT()`, offer valuable insights into data analysis and aggregation in SQL queries.
# DISTINCT
Certainly! The `DISTINCT` keyword in SQL is used to retrieve unique values from a specified column or set of columns. Here's an example:

Consider a table named `employees`:

| id | name    | department |
|----|---------|------------|
| 1  | Alice   | Sales      |
| 2  | Bob     | HR         |
| 3  | Charlie | Sales      |
| 4  | Alice   | Marketing  |
| 5  | Alice   | Sales      |

If you want to retrieve unique department names from the `employees` table, you can use `DISTINCT` as follows:

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;
```

The result of this query will return:

| department |
|------------|
| Sales      |
| HR         |
| Marketing  |

It filters out duplicate values and retrieves only unique values from the specified column (`department` in this case). The `DISTINCT` keyword here ensures that only distinct values are returned, even if there are multiple occurrences of the same value in the column.

# GROUP BY
It seems like you might be referring to the `HAVING` clause in SQL. The `HAVING` clause is used in conjunction with the `GROUP BY` clause to filter data based on groups in SQL queries.

### Example of HAVING Clause:

Consider a table `orders`:

| order_id | customer_id | total_amount |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| 1        | 101         | 200          |
| 2        | 102         | 150          |
| 3        | 101         | 300          |
| 4        | 103         | 100          |
| 5        | 102         | 250          |

Now, suppose you want to find the total amount for each customer and filter out only those customers whose total amount exceeds 250.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total_amount) AS total
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 250;
```

Result:
| customer_id | total |
|-------------|-------|
| 101         | 500   |
| 102         | 400   |

Explanation:
- The `GROUP BY customer_id` groups the records by `customer_id`.
- The `SUM(total_amount)` calculates the total amount for each customer.
- The `HAVING SUM(total_amount) > 250` filters out groups where the total amount exceeds 250.

The `HAVING` clause is similar to the `WHERE` clause but is used specifically with aggregated values resulting from `GROUP BY` operations to filter grouped data based on specified conditions.

# Normalisation

Sure, normalization is a process used in database design to organize data in a way that reduces redundancy and dependency. It involves breaking down a database into smaller, more manageable tables and establishing relationships between them.

### Key Points of Normalization:

1. **Eliminating Redundancy:** Normalization aims to minimize data duplication by breaking larger tables into smaller, related tables. This reduces storage space and prevents inconsistencies.

2. **Maintaining Data Integrity:** By organizing data into separate tables and establishing relationships using keys (such as primary and foreign keys), normalization helps maintain the accuracy and consistency of data.

3. **Reducing Update Anomalies:** Update anomalies occur when changing data in one place leads to inconsistencies or errors in other parts of the database. Normalization reduces such anomalies by storing data in a way that ensures updates are made in only one place.

### Levels of Normalization (Normal Forms):

There are several normal forms, from first normal form (1NF) to higher forms like second normal form (2NF), third normal form (3NF), and so on. Each form has specific rules that a database must meet to qualify for that level of normalization.

- **First Normal Form (1NF):** Ensures each column contains only atomic values (no repeating groups or multiple values in a single column).
  
- **Second Normal Form (2NF):** Complies with 1NF and ensures that each non-key column is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key, avoiding partial dependencies.

- **Third Normal Form (3NF):** Complies with 2NF and eliminates transitive dependencies by ensuring that non-key columns are not dependent on other non-key columns.

Absolutely, let's break down the different Normal Forms (NF) with examples:

### First Normal Form (1NF):

1NF requires that each column in a table contains atomic (indivisible) values, and there are no repeating groups or arrays within a column.

**Example:**

Consider a table that violates 1NF:

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Skills              |
|-------------|---------------|---------------------|
| 101         | John          | Java, SQL, Python   |
| 102         | Alice         | HTML, CSS           |
| 103         | Bob           | JavaScript, Python  |

To achieve 1NF, you'd split the Skills column into separate rows, like this:

| Employee ID | Employee Name | Skill      |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 101         | John          | Java       |
| 101         | John          | SQL        |
| 101         | John          | Python     |
| 102         | Alice         | HTML       |
| 102         | Alice         | CSS        |
| 103         | Bob           | JavaScript |
| 103         | Bob           | Python     |

Each skill now resides in its own row, ensuring atomic values in the table.

### Second Normal Form (2NF):

2NF requires the fulfillment of 1NF and ensures that every non-prime attribute (non-key columns) is fully functionally dependent on the entire primary key.

**Example:**

Consider a table:

| Order ID | Product ID | Product Name | Category     |
|----------|------------|--------------|--------------|
| 001      | 101        | Chair        | Furniture    |
| 002      | 102        | Table        | Furniture    |
| 001      | 103        | Lamp         | Home Décor   |

Here, Order ID and Product ID form the composite primary key. But Category depends only on Product ID, not the entire primary key.

To achieve 2NF, split the table into two:

**Products Table:**
| Product ID | Product Name |
|------------|--------------|
| 101        | Chair        |
| 102        | Table        |
| 103        | Lamp         |

**Categories Table:**
| Product ID | Category    |
|------------|-------------|
| 101        | Furniture   |
| 102        | Furniture   |
| 103        | Home Décor  |

Now, Category is functionally dependent on the Product ID (which is a part of the primary key).

### Third Normal Form (3NF):

Transitivity in tables refers to a scenario where an attribute (non-key column) indirectly determines another attribute through a chain of dependencies.

### Example of Transitivity:

Consider a table:

| Student ID | Course ID | Course Name | Department |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 101        | 501       | Physics     | Science    |
| 102        | 502       | Biology     | Science    |
| 103        | 503       | History     | Humanities |
| 104        | 504       | Math        | Science    |

Here, `Department` depends on `Course Name`, and `Course Name` depends on `Course ID`. Thus, `Student ID` indirectly determines `Department` through `Course ID` and `Course Name`.

### Overcoming Transitivity:

To overcome transitivity and achieve higher normal forms (like 3NF or BCNF), you'd typically decompose the table by breaking it into smaller tables where each table has a clear and direct relationship.

In the given example:

**Courses Table:**
| Course ID | Course Name |
|-----------|-------------|
| 501       | Physics     |
| 502       | Biology     |
| 503       | History     |
| 504       | Math        |

**Departments Table:**
| Course ID | Department  |
|-----------|-------------|
| 501       | Science     |
| 502       | Science     |
| 503       | Humanities  |
| 504       | Science     |

By creating separate tables for courses and departments and establishing direct relationships using keys (`Course ID`), you eliminate transitivity. Now, `Department` directly depends on `Course ID`, and there are no indirect dependencies between attributes.

Normalizing tables in this manner helps maintain data integrity and avoids anomalies related to transitive dependencies during database design and management.

Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) is an advanced level of normalization that addresses certain anomalies in functional dependencies beyond the scope of Third Normal Form (3NF). BCNF ensures that for every functional dependency X → Y in a table, X must be a superkey.

### Example Illustrating BCNF:

Consider a table with student details:

| Student ID | Course ID | Course Name | Department |
|------------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| 101        | 501       | Physics     | Science    |
| 102        | 502       | Biology     | Science    |
| 103        | 503       | History     | Humanities |
| 104        | 504       | Math        | Science    |

In this table, the functional dependencies are:
- Student ID → Course ID, Course Name, Department (assuming each student can be associated with only one course)
- Course ID → Course Name, Department (each course belongs to a specific department)

To achieve BCNF:

1. **Identify Superkeys:**
   - In this case, both `Student ID` and `Course ID` could be considered candidate keys or superkeys.

2. **Check for Violation:**
   - There's a functional dependency `Course ID → Course Name, Department`, where `Course ID` is not a superkey.

3. **Decompose to Achieve BCNF:**

**Students Table:**
| Student ID | Course ID |
|------------|-----------|
| 101        | 501       |
| 102        | 502       |
| 103        | 503       |
| 104        | 504       |

**Courses Table:**
| Course ID | Course Name | Department  |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 501       | Physics     | Science     |
| 502       | Biology     | Science     |
| 503       | History     | Humanities  |
| 504       | Math        | Science     |

By decomposing the initial table into these two tables:

- **Students Table:** Contains information about student-course relationships.
- **Courses Table:** Contains details about courses and their departments.

This decomposition ensures that each table maintains BCNF by having functional dependencies where the determinant (the attribute determining other attributes) is a superkey.

BCNF helps in maintaining data integrity and avoiding certain anomalies related to functional dependencies that might arise in 3NF. It ensures that all functional dependencies in a table are based on superkeys, eliminating non-trivial functional dependencies from candidate keys.

# UNION

Sure, the `UNION` operator in SQL is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows by default.

Let's consider two tables, `students` and `teachers`, and demonstrate how `UNION` works:

**Table: students**
```
| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 3          | Charlie      |
```

**Table: teachers**
```
| teacher_id | teacher_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Emma         |
| 2          | Frank        |
| 3          | Grace        |
| 4          | Alice        |
```

### Example of UNION:

```sql
SELECT student_id, student_name FROM students
UNION
SELECT teacher_id, teacher_name FROM teachers;
```

The result of this `UNION` query will combine the unique rows from both tables:

| student_id | student_name |
|------------|--------------|
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 3          | Charlie      |
| 1          | Emma         |
| 2          | Frank        |
| 3          | Grace        |
| 4          | Alice        |

Explanation:
- The `UNION` operator combines the results of the two SELECT statements.
- It eliminates duplicate rows by default, giving a result set with unique rows from both tables.

If you want to include duplicate rows, you can use `UNION ALL` instead of `UNION`. `UNION ALL` does not remove duplicates and includes all rows from both tables.
