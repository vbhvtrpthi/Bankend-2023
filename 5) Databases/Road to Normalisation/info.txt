class -> object 
Database schema -> Database instance

Axioms are the tools via which you can detect the poor DB design.

DB keys - set of columns which helps  to uniquely identify the rows.

primary key - e_id is better choice over e-phon no as it can be null too. 

Normalisation is nothing but a technique via which you can make your database more clean, more scalable, queries more efficient.

Normal forms (1nf,2nf,...) -> helps us to understand what level of redundancy we have and also gives us the technique to reduce it.


2nf form -> 2nd table:
                      1 emp -> multiple projects
                      1 project -> can have multiple employees
 what all employess are involved in project 1?
    -> query the "employe-proj-join" table (select all the emp_id having p_id as 1)
    -> do the join with the emp_id received from the above table with employee table.

Join table has multiple foreign keys from the other tables


part3 -> In Comments table commentable type could be enum(comment, answer)
         if commentable_type is "answer" then commentable_id is "answer" table id PK
         if commentable_type is "comment" then commentable_id is "comment" table id PK
